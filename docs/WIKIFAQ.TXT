h4. How can I add my own configurations?

You can use the config tag to point an alternative configuration file:

{code}
<fckeditor:config CustomConfigurationsPath="${g.createLinkTo(dir:'js/fckeditor', file: 'fckcustom.js')}"/>
{code}

then create a new file under web-app/js/fckeditor named fckcustom.js (or whatever you want) and include the configurations you want to change.
